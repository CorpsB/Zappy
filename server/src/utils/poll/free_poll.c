/**
 * @file free_poll.c
 * @brief Cleanup functions related to the poll structure of the server.
 * @author No√© Carabin
 * @version 1.0
 * @date 2025-06
 *
 * @details
 * This file provides a function to properly free and clean up all resources
 * associated with the poll system used for managing connected clients.
 *
 * It ensures:
 * - All client sockets are closed.
 * - Dynamically allocated memory for command buffers is freed.
 * - The arrays holding client and poll file descriptor structures are
 * released.
 *
 * This is typically called at server shutdown to avoid memory leaks or file
 * descriptor leaks.
