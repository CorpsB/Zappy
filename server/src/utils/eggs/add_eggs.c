/**
 * @file add_eggs.c
 * @brief Implements egg creation logic for both starter and player-laid eggs.
 * @author NoÃ© Carabin (CorpsB)
 * @version 1.0
 * @date 2025-06
 * @details
 * Provides functions to allocate and initialize egg structures associated
 * with a team. `generate_starter_eggs` randomly places eggs on the map at
 * startup with no creator, while `add_eggs` is used during gameplay when
 * a player lays an egg at a specific position. Eggs are added to the team's
 * linked list and tracked using a global egg ID counter.
