 * @brief Functions to search for a player by ID in the server's team
 * structure.

 *
 * @details
 * This file provides utility functions to locate a player using their
 * unique ID:
 * - `find_in_team()` checks whether a player is present in a specific team.
 * - `find_player_by_id()` traverses all teams in the server to find the
 * player.
 *
 * These functions are essential for player management and allow modules
 * to reference players by ID without storing direct pointers.
