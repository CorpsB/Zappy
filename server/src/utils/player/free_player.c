 * @brief Functions to properly free player-related memory in the Zappy server.
 * @author No√© Carabin
 * @version 1.0
 * @date 2025-06
 *
 * @details
 * This file contains functions to release the memory allocated for players:
 * - `free_a_player()` frees a single player node, including all pending
 * commands.
 * - `free_all_player()` traverses a linked list of players and frees each one.
 *
 * These functions ensure clean deallocation of player resources to prevent
 * memory leaks when players disconnect or when the server shuts down.
